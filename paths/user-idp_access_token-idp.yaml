  summary: Acquire IdP access token
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Acquires an access token issued by given IdP for the current user. This
    operation requires that the IdP is configured to support offline access -
    issues refresh tokens upon user's login to Onezone, which are later used
    to acquire new access tokens when they expire. Offline access can be
    configured by the Onezone admin.

    The user must first log in to Onezone using given IdP,
    otherwise the operation will return a 404 error.

    This operation can be invoked on behalf of current user only.
