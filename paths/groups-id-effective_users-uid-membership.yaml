  summary: Get effective user's group membership intermediaries
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Returns the effective user's (`{uid}`) group membership intermediaries -
    entities from which the user inherits access to the group (`{id}`).
    Special keyword `"self"` in entity id indicates that the user (`{uid}`)
    has a direct access to the group (`{id}`).

    This operation requires any of the following authentication:
    * as user (`{uid}`) who is an effective member of the group (`{id}`),
    * as user who has `group_view` privilege in the group (`{id}`),
    * as user who has `oz_groups_view` admin privilege.
