  summary: Map IdP user to Onezone user
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Maps external IdP user id into internal user id in Onezone.

    The user does not have to exist in Onezone or the IdP - this method merely
    transforms the Id using a deterministic procedure. It can be used to
    predict the user Id in Onezone before it is created.

    This operation has public access.
