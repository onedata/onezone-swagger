  summary: List space owners
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Returns the list of owners of a specific space.

    Space owners are members (users) of the space that have absolute power
    regarding the space API and files (analogical to "root", but in the scope
    of one space). Being an owner means that user privileges are essentially
    ignored and all API operations are allowed.

    This operation requires any of the following authentication:
    * as user who has `space_view` privilege in the space (`{id}`),
    * as provider that supports the space (`{id}`),
    * as user who has `oz_spaces_view` admin privilege.
