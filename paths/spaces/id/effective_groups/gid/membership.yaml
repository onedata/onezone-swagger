  summary: Get effective group's space membership intermediaries
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Returns the effective group's (`{gid}`) space membership intermediaries -
    entities from which the group inherits access to the space (`{id}`).
    Special keyword `"self"` in entity id indicates that the group (`{gid}`)
    has a direct access to the space (`{id}`).

    This operation requires any of the following authentication:
    * as user who is an effective member of the group (`{gid}`),
    * as user who has `space_view` privilege in the space (`{id}`),
    * as provider that supports the space,
    * as user who has `oz_spaces_view` admin privilege.
