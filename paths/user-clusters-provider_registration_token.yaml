  summary: Create provider registration token for current user
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Creates a token for the current user allowing him to register a new provider
    in Onezone. After the registration, the user's account will be automatically
    linked to the new Oneprovider cluster
    (granting him access to Oneprovider's onepanel).

    This operation can be invoked on behalf of the current user only.

    If registration policy in Onezone is configured as `open`, any user can
    generate the token for himself. In case of `restricted` policy, this
    operation requires `oz_providers_invite` privilege.
