  summary: Get effective user's cluster membership intermediaries
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Returns the effective user's (`{uid}`) cluster membership intermediaries -
    entities from which the user inherits membership in the cluster (`{id}`).
    Special keyword `"self"` in entity id indicates that the user (`{uid}`)
    has a direct membership in the cluster (`{id}`).

    This operation requires any of the following authentication:
    * as user (`{uid}`) who is an effective member of the cluster (`{id}`),
    * as user who has `cluster_view` privilege in the cluster (`{id}`),
    * as user who has `oz_clusters_view` admin privilege.
