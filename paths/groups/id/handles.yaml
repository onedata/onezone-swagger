  summary: Create a new handle for given group
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Registers a new Open Data handle in the specified handle service on behalf of a group.
    
    An Open Data handle is essentially a persistent identifier (PID/DOI) that points to
    a resource in Onedata that is to be shared publicly as an Open Data record. 
    All handles are advertised via the OAI-PMH protocol (Onezone serves as a repository
    of Open Data records, to be harvested by Open Data aggregators).

    The handle service serves as a proxy that registers persistent identifiers in an external service
    such as **DataCite** or **handle.net**. It is typically set up by Onezone admins, who grant
    the rights to register handles to specific users/groups.

    This operation requires `group_create_handle` privilege in the group and
    `handle_service_register_handle` privilege in the handle service specified
    in the `handleServiceId` field.  
    For administrator who does not belong to this group
    `oz_groups_add_relationships` and `oz_handles_create` privilege is required.
