  summary: Get effective group's cluster membership intermediaries
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Returns the effective group's (`{gid}`) cluster membership intermediaries -
    entities from which the group inherits membership in the cluster (`{id}`).
    Special keyword `"self"` in entity id indicates that the group (`{gid}`)
    has a direct membership in the cluster (`{id}`).

    This operation requires any of the following authentication:
    * as user who is an effective member of the group (`{gid}`)
    * as user who has `cluster_view` privilege in the cluster (`{id}`)
    * as user who has `oz_clusters_view` admin privilege.
