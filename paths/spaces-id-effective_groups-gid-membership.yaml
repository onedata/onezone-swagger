  summary: Get effective group's space membership intermediaries
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Returns the effective group's (`{gid}`) space membership intermediaries -
    entities from which the group inherits membership in the space (`{id}`).
    Special keyword `"self"` in entity id indicates that the group (`{gid}`)
    has a direct membership in the space (`{id}`).

    This operation requires any of the following authorization:
    * as user who is an effective member of the group (`{gid}`)
    * as user who has `space_view` privilege in the space (`{id}`)
    * as user who has `oz_spaces_view` admin privilege.
