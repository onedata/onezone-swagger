  summary: Create provider registration token for a user
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    This enpoint is deprecated and will be removed in future release,
    please use one of:
    * [create named token](#operation/create_named_token_for_current_user)
    * [create temporary token](#operation/create_temporary_token_for_current_user)

    Creates a token for a specific user allowing him to register a new provider
    in Onezone. After the registration, the user's account will be automatically
    linked to the new Oneprovider cluster
    (granting him access to Oneprovider's onepanel).

    If registration policy in Onezone is configured as `open`, any user can
    generate the token for himself. In case of `restricted` policy or issuing
    the token for another user, this operation requires `oz_providers_invite` privilege.
