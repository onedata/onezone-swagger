  summary: Create a new handle for the current user

    Registers a new Open Data handle in the specified handle service as the current user.
    
    An Open Data handle is essentially a persistent identifier (PID/DOI) that points to
    a resource in Onedata that is to be shared publicly as an Open Data record. 
    All handles are advertised via the OAI-PMH protocol (Onezone serves as a repository
    of Open Data records, to be harvested by Open Data aggregators).

    The handle service serves as a proxy that registers persistent identifiers in an external service
    such as **DataCite** or **handle.net**. It is typically set up by Onezone admins, who grant
    the rights to register handles to specific users/groups.

    This operation can be invoked on behalf of the current user only and requires
    'handle_service_register_handle' privilege in the handle service
    where the new handle is to be registered.
