  summary: Verify an identity token
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Verifies an identity token provided in serialized form. Identity token is
    essentially an access token that can have the authorizationNone caveat
    (which nullifies the authorization carried by the token).
    Upon success, returns the token's subject.
    Optionally, IP address of the token bearer can be provided,
    which will be used to verify against the IP and geolocation related caveats.

    If the token cannot be positively verified, HTTP code 4xx is returned with
    an error describing the reason of failure.

    This operation has public access.
