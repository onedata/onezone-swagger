  summary: Verify an identity token
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Verifies an
    [identity token](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/tokens[identity-tokens].html)
    provided in serialized form. Identity token is a token that carries proof
    of identity, but does not carry authorization to perform any operations in
    the system. Upon success, returns the token's subject.

    Optionally, contextual information that may be required to verify token
    caveats can be provided in the request body:

    * IP address of the token bearer - defaults to the requesting client's IP,
    * consumer's identity token - consumer defaults to the authenticated client
      if valid token credentials are sent with this request, or `null` otherwise,
    * interface to which the token bearer has connected - defaults to `null` (undefined interface).

    If the token cannot be positively verified, HTTP code 4xx is returned with
    an error describing the reason of failure.

    This operation has public access.

    ***Example cURL requests***

    **Verify an identity token**
    ```bash
