  summary: Verify an identity token
  x-bash-codegen-description: |
    Verifies an
    [identity token][identity token](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/access_and_invite_tokens.html#identity-tokens)
    provided in serialized form. Identity token is
    essentially an access token that can have the `scope = identityToken` caveat
    (which nullifies the authorization carried by the token).
    Upon success, returns the token's subject.
    Optionally, contextual information that may be required to verify token
    caveats can be provided in the request body: IP address of the token bearer,
    service which is handling the request, interface on which the request has
    been made and information if data access caveats should be allowed in the
    token. One exception is the consumer, which depends on the authentication
    of the client that performs verification.

    If the token cannot be positively verified, HTTP code 4xx is returned with
    an error describing the reason of failure.

    This operation has public access.
