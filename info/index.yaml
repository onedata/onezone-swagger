 This is the RESTful API definition of Onezone component of Onedata data management system [http://www.onedata.org].

 This API allows control and configuration of local Onezone service deployment, in particular management
 of users, spaces, groups and providers.

 ## Authentication
 In order to be able to use this API the REST client must be able to authenticate with the Onezone service.

 Currently this is supported through authentication token which can be generate using the Onedata user interface. 
 The token must be added to the request header:
  - TODO

 In addition please take into account, that depending on your account authorization rights, not all operations
 may be possible. In particular, some operations depend on whether a particular request is initiated by a regular
 user or by another storage provider within a zone.

 ## API structure
 Most operations are RESTful, i.e. paths reflect the actual resource mode and operations on them are mapped to
 most appropriate HTTP methods.


 ### Space management
 The space management operations of this API provide means for accessing information about spaces 
 and their management.
 
 ### Group management
 The group management operations allow for creation of user groups, assigning their authorization rights,
 adding and removing users from groups.

 ### Provider management
 TODO
