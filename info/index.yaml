 This is the RESTful API definition of Onezone component of Onedata data
 management system [onedata.org].

 This API allows control and configuration of local Onezone service deployment,
 in particular management of users, spaces, groups and providers.


 REST API operations from the permissions perspective in Onezone service can
 be divided into 2 groups, depending on the actor making the request:
 **User requests**
 regular end user requests are authenticated based on the `X-Auth-Token` header,
 which must include valid client access token, and authorization is made based
 on the privileges assigned to the user in the system. Each operation in this
 API that is available to end users, has a list of required privileges, except
 for the operations which are related to user account management, i.e.each user
 can perform any operation on his account, the `X-Auth-Token` header example:
  ```
    X-Auth-Token:IAUYCGOUASGDJHASDJKVAHSDJHASDKJHABSDKJHBASKJHJHBASD...
  ```
 **Provider requests**
 When a Oneprovider service needs to request some action from the Onezone
 service, it must authenticate using the peer certificate which was assigned to
 this provider when registering in the Onezone service.


 ## Effective users and effective groups
 Onedata supports creation of arbitrary nested group tree structures. In order
 to allow identification if a given user belongs to the group directly or
 indirectly by belonging to a subgroup of a group, separate API calls are
 provided for getting information about group users (direct group members) and
 effective users (indirect group members).

 ## API structure
 Most operations are RESTful, i.e. paths reflect the actual resource mode and
 operations on them are mapped to most appropriate HTTP methods.

 ## Space management
 The space management operations of this API provide means for accessing
 information about spaces and their management.

 ## Group management
 The group management operations allow for creation of user groups, assigning
 their authorization rights, adding and removing users from groups.

 ## User management
 The user management methods enable for creation of users, managing their
 authorization credentials as well as space and group membership.

 ## Provider management
 Provider specific calls enable for getting global information about the
 spaces managed by the provider, and some administrative operations which can
 be used for monitoring or accounting.

 ## Handle API
 Onezone provides extensive support for integration with Handle system
 registration services, including support for DOI and PID identifier assignment
 services. The API provides methods for adding new Handle services to the
 system, managing which users can use which registration services and complete
 API for registering identifiers to users data sets which are made public.

 # Overview
 This is the RESTful API definition of Onezone component of Onedata data management system [onedata.org](http://www.onedata.org).

 > This API is defined using [Swagger](http://swagger.io/), the JSON specification can be used to automatically generate
 > client libraries - [swagger.json](../../../swagger/onezone/swagger.json).

 This API allows control and configuration of local Onezone service deployment, in particular management
 of users, spaces, groups and providers.

 ## Authentication and permissions
 In order to be able to use this API the REST client must be able to authenticate with the Onezone service.

 REST API operations from the permissions perspective in Onezone service can be divided into 2 groups,
 depending on the actor making the request:
  * **User requests** - regular end user requests are authenticated based on the `X-Auth-Token` header, which
  must include valid client access token, and authorization is made based on the privileges assigned
  to the user in the system. Each operation in this API that is available to end users, has a list of
  required privileges, except for the operations which are related to user account management, i.e.
  each user can perform any operation on his account, the `X-Auth-Token` header example:
  ```
    X-Auth-Token: IAUYCGOUASGDJHASDJKVAHSDJHASDKJHABSDKJHBASKJHDBKJHASBDKJHBASDKJHBASD...
  ```
  * **Provider requests** - when a Oneprovider service needs to request some action from the Onezone service,
  it must authenticate using the peer certificate which was assigned to this provider when registering
  in the Onezone service. In such case the `X-Auth-Token` header is not necessary.

 Some special operations are completely open and require no authentication:
  * `POST /user/authorize` - authorizes user with authentication token through
  Onezone web interface.This interface is called only by providers,
  * `POST /provider` - registers a Oneprovider in Onezone service
  (however a valid CSR in the body is required),
  * `POST /provider/test/check_my_ports` - checks if all given ports
  are reachable from Onezone,
  * `GET /provider/test/check_my_ip` - returns the external IP of the request peer (as seen by the Onezone).

 The provider specific operations include:
  * `ALL /provider` - all provider specific endpoints (except for the public access ones above),
  * `POST /spaces` - create new space,
  * `GET /space/{id}` - get specific space details,
  * `GET /spaces/{id}/users` - list space users.

 All other operations can be invoked by a user assuming he has valid privileges in the system,
 each operation description lists required permissions, if any.

 ## Effective users and effective groups
 Onedata supports creation of arbitrary nested group tree structures. In order to allow identification
 if a given user belongs to the group directly or indirectly by belonging to a subgroup of a group,
 separate API calls are provided for getting information about group users (direct group members) and
 effective users (indirect group members).

 ## API structure
 Most operations are RESTful, i.e. paths reflect the actual resource mode and operations on them are mapped to
 most appropriate HTTP methods.

 **Space management**
 The space management operations of this API provide means for accessing information about spaces
 and their management.

 **Group management**
 The group management operations allow for creation of user groups, assigning their authorization rights,
 adding and removing users from groups.

 **User management**
 The user management methods enable for creation of users, managing their authorization
 credentials as well as space and group membership.

 **Provider management**
 Provider specific calls enable for getting global information about the spaces managed by the provider,
 and some administrative operations which can be used for monitoring or accounting.

 **Handle API**
 Onezone provides extensive support for integration with Handle system registration
 services, including support for DOI and PID identifier assignment services. The API
 provides methods for adding new Handle services to the system, managing which users
 can use which registration services and complete API for registering identifiers to
 users data sets which are made public.


 ## Examples

 **Generate new authentication token**
 ```bash
 curl -k -u user:PaSSwoRd -X GET \
 https://beta.onedata.org:8443/api/v3/onezone/user/client_token
 ```

 **Get user details**
 ```bash
 curl -k https://beta.onedata.org:8443/api/v3/onezone/user \
 -H 'X-Auth-Token:MDAxNWxvY2F0aW9uIG9uZXpvbmUKMDAzYmlk'
