  dataWrite:
    type: string
    enum:
      - global
      - none
    description: |
      [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - always `global`] indicates if the Oneprovider
      that supports the space by consuming this token will be able to modify
      files in the space (`global`) or not (`none`).
  metadataReplication:
    type: string
    enum:
      - eager
      - lazy
      - none
    description: |
      [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - always `eager`] indicates the level of metadata
      replication on the Oneprovider that supports the space by consuming this
      token. `eager` - all metadata is replicated, might take days to become
      in sync if the space is already populated with large amount of data.
      `lazy` - only required metadata is replicated when specific file is
      accessed. `none` - all metadata is fetched from remote Oneproviders
      every time a request is performed, which is the slowest option but
      requires minimal resources on the Oneprovider.
required:
  - dataWrite
  - metadataReplication
example:
  dataWrite: global
  metadataReplication: lazy
