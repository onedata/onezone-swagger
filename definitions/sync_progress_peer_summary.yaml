properties:
  seenSeq:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Last sequence number of the corresponding provider that has been seen
      and processed by *subject* provider.
  seqTimestamp:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Timestamp in seconds (UNIX epoch) when the sequence number has been
      emitted by the corresponding provider.
  diff:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Difference between the latest seq emitted by a peer provider and the
      latest seq seen by the *subject* provider. Indicates the number of
      changes that need to be seen to become fully synced.
  delay:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Difference between the timestamp of the latest seq emitted by a peer provider
      and the timestamp of the latest seq seen by the *subject* provider (in seconds).
      Indicates the delay of changes propagation between the providers.
  desync:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates desynchronization state - when the seq synchronization delay
      between the *subject* and peer providers exceeds a certain threshold.
      If true, the *subject* provider should be perceived as having a
      considerably outdated view on changes made by the peer.
example:
  seenSeq: 2450
  seqTimestamp: 1571147494
  diff: 198
  delay: 18
  desync: false
