  Sync progress summary of the *subject* provider.
properties:
  legacy:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Denotes that the *subject* provider is in legacy version and does not
      recognize the sync progress model. Such provider does not report its
      progress and will have default entries in the registry (`seq = 1`).
      It will be marked as joining until it is upgraded - then is starts
      catching up with modern providers.
  joining:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates that the *subject* provider is not yet actively supporting the
      space, but catching up with changes from peer providers. It is set to
      `false` when all the changes have been synchronized. After that, this flag
      remains unchanged during the support lifecycle (the `desync` flag
      is used to indicate temporary desynchronization).
  archival:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Denotes that the *subject* provider does not support the space anymore and
      the stored values are archival - the registry state is "frozen" at the
      moment of space unsupport. Such entries are kept until all peer providers
      have seen the latest seq of the retired provider - and then removed in the
      process of pruning the registry.
  desync:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates desynchronization state - when the synchronization delay
      between the *subject* provider and any other exceeds a certain threshold.
      The provider marked with desync should be perceived as having a
      considerably outdated view on current changes in the space.
  lastReport:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Timestamp in seconds (UNIX epoch) of the last sync progress report
      submitted by the *subject* provider. The special value of `-1` denotes that
      the time of last report is **unknown** - the provider has not reported its
      sync progress yet, or it is in legacy version and the last report time
      will not be known until it is upgraded.
  perPeer:
    type: object
    description: |
      Sync progress of the *subject* provider with *peer* providers. Expresses
      the knowledge of *subject* provider about latest database sequence numbers
      generated by *peer* providers.

      Sync progress stats are represented by a map (key-value) with all providers
      supporting this space, where key is the Id of *peer* provider and value is
      the corresponding summary of sync progress of the *subject* provider with
      the *peer*.

      Includes entry for *subject* provider (self), which denotes the current
      newest sequence number emmitted by *subject* provider and its timestamp.
