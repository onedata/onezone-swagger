type: object
description: >
  Expresses the sync progress of the *subject* provider with a *peer* provider.
  Each provider has an entry for itself that denotes the latest emitted seq and
  its timestamp.
properties:
  seenSeq:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Last sequence number of the *peer* provider that has been seen
      and processed by *subject* provider. Seq stands for database sequence -
      an increasing number that reflects the number of changed documents in
      database since the beginning of space support.
  seqTimestamp:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Timestamp in seconds (UNIX epoch) when the database document associated
      with the sequence number has been persisted by the *peer* provider.
      Initially set to the space creation time (for `seq = 1`).
  diff:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Difference between the latest seq emitted by a *peer* provider and the
      latest seq seen by the *subject* provider. Indicates the number of
      changes that need to be seen to become fully synced.
  delay:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Difference between the timestamp of the latest seq emitted by a *peer* provider
      and the timestamp of the latest seq seen by the *subject* provider (in seconds).
      Indicates the delay of changes propagation between the providers.
  desync:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates desynchronization state - when the seq synchronization delay
      between the *subject* and *peer* providers exceeds a certain threshold.
      If true, the *subject* provider should be perceived as having a
      considerably outdated view on changes made by the *peer*.
