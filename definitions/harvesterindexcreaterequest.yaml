    description: The name of the index.
  guiPluginName:
    type: string
    description: 
      Mapping of index name to one recognized by gui plugin.
      Allows to specify this index to be used by GUI plugin to produce search results.
      Recognized gui index names are listed in gui plugin manifest.
  schema:
    type: string
    description: Schema of the index provided as string (e.g. encoded JSON).
  includeMetadata:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      enum: [json, xattrs, rdf]
    minItems: 1
    description: 
      Specifies what types of file metadata should be harvested in this index. At least one type must be given.
  includeFileDetails:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      enum: [fileName, spaceId, metadataExistenceFlags]
    description: 
      Specifies what file details should be harvested alongside the metadata. Enabling 
      `metadataExistenceFlags` will add boolean flags saying whether the file has any metadata 
      of certain type. The `fileName` field may be utilized by the GUI plugin to improve the 
      browsing experience.
  includeRejectionReason:
    type: boolean
    description: 
      If enabled, all harvesting errors (e.g. when the index rejects a payload due to non-matching schema) 
      are stored as text in the index, which may be useful for later analysis.
  retryOnRejection:
    type: boolean
    description: 
      If enabled, all payloads rejected by the harvesting backend will be automatically analysed for 
      offending data (e.g. fields that do not match the schema), pruned and submitted again. This might 
      slow down the harvesting process and cause nonconformant metadata to be lost.
