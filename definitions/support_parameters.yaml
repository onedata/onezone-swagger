type: object
description: Space support parameters.
properties:
  accountingEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates if accounting is enabled. The accounting mechanism
      utilizes directory statistics to keep track of quota usage
      within a space for the corresponding supporting provider.<br/>
      It can be toggled by an administrator of the provider with
      `cluster_update` privilege or by an administrator of the zone
      with `oz_spaces_update` privilege.
  dirStatsServiceEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates if the directory statistics service should be enabled.
      The service gathers statistics concerning logical and physical
      directory size, file count and update times.<br/>
      It can be toggled by a space member with `space_update` privilege,
      by an administrator of the provider with `cluster_update` privilege
      or by an administrator of the zone with `oz_spaces_update` privilege.<br/>
      **NOTE**: Directory statistics are required for accounting and cannot
      be disabled independently.<br/>
      **NOTE**: Statistics collection causes an additional load on the provider
      and has a slight negative impact on file operation performance.<br/>
      **NOTE**: Applying a new setting may take some time, depending on the
      space size and current state of the directory statistics service. This
      process is reflected by the `initializing` and `stopping` intermediate statuses.
  dirStatsServiceStatus:
    type: string
    enum:
      - initializing
      - enabled
      - stopping
      - disabled
    description: |
      The current status of the directory statistics service, as reported by the
      supporting provider. It cannot be modified by a user. May be different from
      the `dirStatsServiceEnabled` setting if the service is in one of the intermediate
      states or the provider has not yet acknowledged a change in the parameters.
example:
  accountingEnabled: false
  dirStatsServiceEnabled: true
  dirStatsServiceStatus: enabled
