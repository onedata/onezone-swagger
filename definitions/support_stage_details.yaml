      Current support stage of the provider - depends on the stages of its storages:

      * `joining` - the provider has freshly supported the space and is catching up
        with dbsync changes from other providers

      * `active` - the provider is operational and up-to-date with other providers,
        all storages are in 'active' stage

      * `remodelling` - the provider is undergoing changes concerning its storage(s)
        that support the space, e.g. a storage has been added or removed
        and is not yet in active stage (such modifications may require
        long-lasting data transfers between storages).

      * `evicting_replicas` (unsupporting) - the provider has chosen to cease support
        for the space with all of its storages and is now safely migrating
        data to other providers

      * `purging_storages` (unsupporting) - the provider has evicted all replicas and
        is now purging its storages from support remnants

      * `purging_database` (unsupporting) - the provider purged its storages and is
        now purging the database (including file metadata, locations etc)

      * `retired` - the provider has supported the space in the past, but not anymore

        Current support stage of the provider - depends on the stages of its storages:

        * `joining` - phase of initial setup after a space is supported and when the
          storage cannot be used yet, transitions to active when the
          provider has caught up with dbsync changes from other providers.

        * `active` - the storage is operational

        * `resizing:<targetSize>` - the granted storage quota by this storage is being
          changed, which may be a long process if replicas need to be
          evicted to free up space. If support is being completely revoked,
          the stage yields `resizing:0`. During resizing, the target size
          may be changed.

        * `purging` (unsupporting) - the file data on the storage is being purged

        * `retiring` (unsupporting) - the owning provider is finalizing the storage's
          retirement process - if this was the last supporting storage, it
          is purging the database by deleting docs related to space support.

        * `retired` - the storage has supported the space in the past, but not anymore
