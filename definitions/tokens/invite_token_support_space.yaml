        [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - always `global`] indicates if the Oneprovider
        that supports the space by consuming this token will be able to modify
        files in the space (`global`) or not (`none`).

        [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - always `eager`] indicates the level of metadata
        replication on the Oneprovider that supports the space by consuming this
        token. `eager` - all metadata is replicated, might take days to become
        in sync if the space is already populated with large amount of data.
        `lazy` - only required metadata is replicated when specific file is
        accessed. `none` - all metadata is fetched from remote Oneproviders
        every time a request is performed, which is the slowest option but
        requires minimal resources on the Oneprovider.
