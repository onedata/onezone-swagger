        Scope caveat - limits the authorization carried by the token. Currently
        only `identityToken` scope is allowed, which nullifies the
        authorization. Such token can only be used for identity verification
        (a.k.a. [identity token](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/access_and_invite_tokens.html#identity-tokens)).
        If no such caveat is present, the token is considered a regular access token.

        You can learn more about token caveats
        [here](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/access_and_invite_tokens.html#token-caveats).
