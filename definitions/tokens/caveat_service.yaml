        Service caveat - limits the services that can process the token.
        [Service](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/access_and_invite_tokens.html#service)
        is the Onedata service that received the client's request - e.g. the
        Oneprovider service chosen by a user to mount a Oneclient or make a CDMI
        request. If the caveat is present, the service must prove its identity
        by sending their
        [identity token](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/access_and_invite_tokens.html#identity-tokens)
        in the `x-onedata-service-token header` along with the request.
        The services must be encoded using proper
        [service format](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/access_and_invite_tokens.html#service).

        You can learn more about token caveats
        [here](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/access_and_invite_tokens.html#token-caveats).
