        GEO Region caveat - limits the geographical regions from which the token
        can be utilized. The available values are the 7 continents (Oceania
        covers Australia and the pacific islands) or the EU meta region, which
        matches member countries of the European Union. The client's region is
        resolved based on client's IP and MaxMind's GeoLite database.
