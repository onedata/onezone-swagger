        Interface caveat - limits the available interfaces on which
        the token can be used to a certain one.

        If the *oneclient* interface is specified, this caveat is treated as a
        **data access caveat** - if added to a token, it greatly limits
        its power in the system APIs, to the minimum required for data access -
        [see more](https://onedata.org/#/home/documentation/doc/using_onedata/tokens[data-access-caveats].html).

        Example:

          {

            "interface": "rest"
          }
        ```
required:
  - type
  - interface
example:
  type: interface
  interface: rest
