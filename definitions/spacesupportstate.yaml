  Current support state of a provider:

  * `joining` - phase of initial setup after a space is supported and when the
     provider is catching up with dbsync changes from other providers
  * `active` - the provider is operational and up-to-date with other providers
  * `desync` - the provider is falling behind other providers in terms of dbsync
     changes and has outdated view on resources in the space
  * `remodelling` - the provider has recently ceased support for the space with
     one of its storages, but still supports it with another one, which
     requires remodelling (moving around) of data on the storages
  * `retiring` - the provider has recently ceased support for the space with all
     of its storages and is now safely migrating data and metadata to
     other providers
  * `retired` - the provider has supported the space in the past
